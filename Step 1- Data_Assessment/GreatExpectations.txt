Great Expectations is a tool used to assess data quality and correctness by defining "expectations" that describe the desired properties of your data. These expectations can check for conditions like non-null values, specific data types, value ranges, uniqueness, or even more complex custom rules. Once set, you can run validation checks on your data, generating reports that highlight any deviations from the defined expectations. This helps ensure data integrity and provides transparency on data quality throughout your pipeline.
