# Kedro Data Pipeline

This repository contains a Kedro-based data pipeline for [brief description of what your pipeline does]. The pipeline processes [brief description of the input data] and outputs [brief description of the output].

## Installation

Before you can run the pipeline, you need to install the required dependencies. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

    It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv kedro-env
    source kedro-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `kedro-env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    Install all required dependencies using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file in the repository:

    ```bash
    pip install -r src/requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install Kedro:**

    If you don't have Kedro installed globally, install it:

    ```bash
    pip install kedro
    ```

## Setup

1. **Dataset Configuration:**

    Place your datasets in the appropriate directory. Ensure that you have the datasets required for the pipeline and that they are properly configured in the `conf/base/catalog.yml` or `conf/local/catalog.yml` file. If you’re working with multiple environments, make sure to configure the correct dataset paths in the corresponding environment YAML files.

2. **Configuration Files:**

    The Kedro project is configured via YAML files under the `conf` directory. You can adjust the pipeline configurations or dataset paths in `conf/base/` and `conf/local/` directories if necessary. Ensure that the paths for your datasets are correctly set in the `catalog.yml`.

## Running the Pipeline

Once you've installed the dependencies and configured your datasets, you can run the pipeline using the following command:

```bash
kedro run
